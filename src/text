Here's an overview of the key features you could implement to enhance your to-do list app:

1. **Task Filtering**: Allow users to filter tasks based on different criteria such as completed, incomplete, date, priority, etc. This can help users organize and focus on specific tasks.

2. **Task Sorting**: Enable users to sort tasks based on different attributes like date, priority, or alphabetical order. This can help users quickly find the tasks they need.

3. **Task Categories/Labels**: Allow users to categorize tasks into different categories or add labels to them. This can help users organize and prioritize their tasks more effectively.

4. **Search Functionality**: Implement a search feature that allows users to search for specific tasks by keyword. This can make it easier for users to find tasks, especially when they have a large number of tasks.

5. **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication to allow users to sign up, log in, and manage their tasks securely. This can also enable features like saving tasks across sessions and syncing tasks across devices.

6. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to handle cases where tasks cannot be added, updated, or deleted due to network issues or other errors. Provide clear error messages to users to help them understand and resolve the issue.

By adding these features, you can make your to-do list app more functional, user-friendly, and portfolio-worthy.
